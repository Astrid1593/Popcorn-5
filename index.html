            I am Popcorn, as you already know. I am the cutest and most special dog of all! (Obviously) I come from an uncommon mix of breeds, Border Collie and Flat-Coat Retriever. My birthday is on February 9th, and not long ago I just had my second birthday! I like running and annoying William, as I said below. When I'm bored, I watch the end of our court from outside, in case any danger comes round. I love drinking water and playing with my toys, especially playing Chasey! And when I get sick of my soccer balls, I shred them to pieces. Once, I even got hold of a Jenga Block when Tica (me, but my mum trained him as that being my name. It's my nickname from when I was little and I used to think that was my name, in case you wonder) and another girl was in Tica's bedroom. Also, I'm very smart. You can never trick me three times. If you trick me once or twice, I won't fall for it again! I'm also a guard dog. Specifically, one that wasn't even trained to be one. I'm just like that, no training involved. But Tica always tells me to "shut up." =(
            Well that's all I really know about myself.... yeah..... I hope I'm a very interesting doggo. üê∂

(I think the language is called Romanian?) But he makes me mad all the time by punching Tica (me irl but that's what my mum taught Popcorn my name is lol)!
